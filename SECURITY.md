# Security Policy

Security is a top priority for us at *iza*. If you discover a security issue,
please bring it to our attention immediately. This document outlines how to
report vulnerabilities and our process for handling them.

## üö® Reporting a Vulnerability

Please **do not file a public GitHub issue**,instead, report it securely by:

- Sending an email to **[sarvsav+iza@gmail.com](mailto:sarvsav+iza@gmail.com)**
- Or using our secure form: **[Report](https://sarvsav.github.io/iza/security)**

Reporter(s) can expect a response within 2 working days, acknowledging the issue
was received.

## üõ°Ô∏è Our Process

We aim to issue a coordinated disclosure and patch **within 30 days** of initial
contact. We may communicate privately with you for details.

## üîç Responsible Disclosure

By responsibly disclosing a vulnerability, you allow us to address the issue
before public disclosure. Please wait until a fix is released or an agreed-upon
timeline has passed.
If you publicly disclose before we resolve or patch, we reserve the right to
release our own advisory. We value your cooperation in keeping users safe.

## Accreditation

We appreciate your help in keeping *iza* secure. If you report a vulnerability,
we will acknowledge your contribution in our security advisory, unless you
request otherwise. Unfortunately, we do not currently offer a paid security
bounty program at this time.
